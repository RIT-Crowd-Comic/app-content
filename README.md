This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) that uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and animation.

## Getting Started

1. Install all dependencies using ```npm i```
2. Run the development server with ```npm run dev```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Things to Note

Use ```npm run lint``` or ```npm run lint:fix``` to check code before committing
These also run during a push and pull request
